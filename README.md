# Crowdfunding-ETL
## This challenge was to execute the complete ETL process with a set of data Britta and I have been working on for weeks! We are specifically going to use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extraction and transform section of this challenge. Then we are going to export the data into SQL via CSV files so that we can perform data analysis.
